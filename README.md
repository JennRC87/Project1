# Project1
my 1st game

User Story:
- As the player I want to play this game because I like story games and I like film noir.




Phase One Pseudo Code/MVP:
- make shapes that act in the place of characters
- figure out how to get the characters to appear and disappear (timed)
- figure out how to use the mouse to shoot at characters
- figure out how shooting villain will prompt a win
- make five villians
- write story to the game
- for every so many misses get the villain to attack and you lose
- get text to display on the screen to tell the user the directions to the story
- get “The White Transvaal Lion to display on the screen


Bonus:
- get the user’s avatar to slide across the screen with the mouse
- make buttons to pause game 


Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery

Approach Taken:
I wanted to make a shooting game that I was familiar with so that I could better understand the lessons that we have already learned. I wanted to change it so that it wasn't the exact same game that we learned in class. I added some new features like music that was shown, but not taught. I was excited when I thought of taking the shooting game and applying it to an interest of mine, old movies. I got the idea to turn my game into a P.I. game to recover The White Transvaal Lion, as play on The Maltese Falcon.
