my 1st game

User Story:
- As the player I want to play this game because I like story games and I like film noir.




Pseudo Code:
- make shapes that act in the place of characters
- figure out how to get the characters to appear and disappear (timed)
- figure out how to use the mouse to shoot at characters
- figure out how shooting villain will prompt a win
- make five villians
- write story to the game
- for every so many misses get the villain to attack and you lose

- get text to display on the screen to tell the user the directions to the story
- get “The White Transvaal Lion to display once the user has won



MVP:
- get the user’s avatar to slide across the screen with the mouse
- make buttons to pause game 
- get “The White Transvaal Lion to display once the user has won
