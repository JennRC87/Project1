              You walk into your office. It's early in the morning, and you’re dragging your body along. Maybe it wasn’t such a bright idea getting soused last night. You hear a sound coming from your office. You take out your rod. Nobody should be here this early. As you slowly open the door you notice a blond dame examining your office. She has a nice set of gams on her. You just stand back and examine her. She sees the dust on the bookshelf and shakes her head in disgust. You just hold in a chuckle. Ever since the maid split, you haven’t even bothered to clean. I guess some people are keen on the idea of getting paid. She hasn’t noticed you yet. You examine her to see what she’ll do next. She starts trying to open draws, and that’s when you open the door so she can hear it squeak. She jumps, and turns in astonishment. She’s even better looking when you can see her face. She’s mesmerizing.

              “Are you Private Investigator Ryan Mason?” You nod.
              “Cat got your tongue?” You shake your head.
              “Some people are born without manners.”
              “Was that why you were trying to go through my personal files?” She doesn’t say another word.
              “Cat got your tongue?” She looks at you through squinted eyes.
              “Look, let’s get down to business. I need your help. I came to San Fransisco to visit my sister.” She’s lying.
              “I tried calling her, but she didn’t answer, so I decided to take a taxi to her place.  When I arrived at her apartment the door was ripped off it’s hinges and the place was ransacked.” She’s still lying.
              “I found this letter on her dining room table.”

              If you want to see your precious Lauren again, bring The White Transvaal Lion to Pier 39.

              She pulled out 2 crisp $100 bills and placed them on my desk. “Will this be enough?”
              You pick them up and examine them, and place them in your pocket.

              Who is this woman, and where did she come from? I know I shouldn’t trust her, but I always had a thing for blonds. Let’s go get this Transvaal Lion!

              Your task is to shoot all five goons to retrieve The White Transvaal Lion. Be careful with that rod. You only have 9 bullets or your dead!
